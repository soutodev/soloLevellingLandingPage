                <p> Sung Jinwoo is the main protagonist of Solo Leveling. Originally an infamously weak E-Rank Hunter, 
                    he got the chance of a lifetime when he was selected as the Player of the System, 
                    giving him the unique ability to grow in strength without restraint. 
                    As a result, by taking advantage of the opportunities offered to him by the System, 
                    Jinwoo eventually rose to power as humanity's greatest hunter and the second Shadow Monarch. </p>
                
                <p>Jinwoo is a confident individual with a strong sense of family and a thirst for power. 
                    As a result, he is very close to his sister, mother, and Jinho, and rarely wastes an opportunity to grow stronger.</p>
